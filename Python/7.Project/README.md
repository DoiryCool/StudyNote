# Introduction

This applet is useless, and i also don't konw what is it used for.

## 1.Enviroment

python3.x maybe all valid,but um not sure,You'd better use :`python == 3.8`

And you must install following libraries.

```shell
pip install pyqt5-tools opencv-python
```

## 2.Problems
As i use VS Code to write this applet,there is a path problem,just cause some  `import` problems,so you shoud manually debug it.
